/*
The idea of syncing every second ensures that the changes we made are always present on disk.
Without the sync, it would be up to the OS to decide when to flush the file to disk.
With this approach, we ensure that the data is always available even in case of a crash.
If we lose any data, it would only be within the second of the crash, which is an acceptable rate.
If you want 100% durability, we wonâ€™t need the goroutine.
Instead, we would sync the file every time a command is executed.
However, this would result in poor performance for write operations because IO operations are expensive.
